# Introduction
Looking at making a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to come up with Harry Potter fiction.

# Data Cleaning
Found text files of all 7 books online. They are formatted slightly different in how titles and chapters are labeled.
Combined all the text together.
Removed non-ascii characters (there was one).

* Data is not hosted here

# Code
Initial code based off Andrej Karpathy's gist and article (http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)
Converted to Python V3 and other simple changes
Need to come up with a way to save state so can stop and restart

# To Do
- Run on an AWS machine with lots of gpu'save
- Add save state so can stop and restart.
